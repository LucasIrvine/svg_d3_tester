SVG/D3 Scatter Plot Node Count Tester
=============

SVG/D3 rendering test

A simple test built to see the cost of panning and zooming in a D3 scatter plot.  Add as many points as you like then zoom and pan around to see the browser lag based on the number of point you add. I start a new date on click and end it and give the millisecond count so you can get relative load time estimations between browsers.
